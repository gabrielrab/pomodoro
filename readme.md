This is a Pomodoro App built in Electron + React.

## About Pomodoro

The Pomodoro Technique is a method of time management. The technique consists of using a stopwatch to divide the work into periods of 25 minutes, separated by brief intervals.

## Features

In addition to the basic functions of a pomodoro stopwatch, we have:

- Native notification sending.
- Possibility to pause the session.
- Information on the end of the session.
- Session counter.
- 'Long break' after 4 sessions.
- Representative GIF for each state (stop, work, break)
